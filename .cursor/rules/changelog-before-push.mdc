# Changelog before push

Before committing and pushing to git:

1. **Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md`** with an entry under **Unreleased** that describes the changes in this push.
2. Use the existing entry template in the changelog (Date, Area, Summary, Rationale, Files changed, Manual test plan).
3. Only then run `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.

Do not push without adding a corresponding changelog entry for the changes being committed.
